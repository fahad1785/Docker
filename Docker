Docker is a containerization opensource platform used for making containers for
running distributing and packaging applications with minimal use of resources.
Containerization is the process of making containers that is a better alternative than full machine virtualization like VMS.
Docker uses host operating system resources, which makes it more compatible, and application spin-up time is reduced as compared to VMS.
Docker-hub is a central repository for saving and contributing container images.

With the help of cotainerization we can achieve the purpose of testing and running applications with minimal use of resources and cost.
Kubernetes plays a vital role in containerization management and it is being used currently by many IT giants.
